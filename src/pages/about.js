          The Pandemic
        </h1>
        <p>When the initial reports of the pandemic of COVID-19 began to circle the internet and news rooms, my wife Ashley and I were starting our new lives as digital nomads. However, sometimes things just don't go as planned.</p>
        <p>We were in Oregon at the time, and the phone calls we were getting from back home in California were making the situation sound probably worse that it was (i.e. no toilet paper)</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, we would soon find out that the short supply of paper products were the least of everyones worries.</p>

          From Fear to Love
        </h1>
        <p>When we got back to California, we noticed that indeed somethings were different than when we had left. It wasn't the lack of paper products or non-perishables in the stores that was really getting to us - it was the darkness.</p>
        <p>We had stopped for some dinner at In n' Out, at west coast favorite, and we noticed something different, strange, and eerie. All of the lights from the surrounding businesses were off. Lockdown hadn't officially begun yet, but most businesses had closed up shop.</p>
        <p>It felt very Orwellian and just didn't sit right with us. We talked about it and went through our moments of terror. Being that I work on a product that supports churches and large scale organization that involve volunteers, I immediately began to wonder about my job and financial security.</p>
        <p>Thankfully, I work for a great company and the leadership there calmed all of us and assured us of their preparation of how long this might last. But I still couldn't shake this feeling of dread.</p>
        <p>Then, I had a melt down. I started to think about all the people that were out of work as a result of this terrible virus. How their lives were temporarily turned upside down.</p>
        <p>My mind went right to every single sci-fi apolocolyptic movie I had seen. Flashbacks of my upbringing at a cult-like christian school began to surface, where I would hear about stories of the anti-christ, end of the world, I could go on.</p>
        <p>But then, something happened. I felt this overwhelming peace that I couldn't explain. Something that I have felt only a few times before in life. This feeling of being protected, even though I know I don't deserve it. But the feeling was there none the less.</p>
        <p>After a few moments of prayer, I took a shower, and then this phrase came to me: <strong>Six Feet Apart - Love in Your Heart</strong>.</p>
